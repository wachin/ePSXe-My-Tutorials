P.E.Op.S./Pete's MesaGL Linux PSX GPU
* Ah, yeah :) My Linux hw/accel. GPU port... it will be running fine at least on nVidias xfree4 glx, but all other cards with hw acceleration could also work. The Linux ports of PÂ©SX and ePSXe are supporting this plugin, and I've also done a small test application for the plugin. You can get the source code of the test app from my plugin development page.
